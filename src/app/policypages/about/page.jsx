            <Section title="3. Our Story">
              <p>
                AltF Tools started as a personal toolbox — scripts reused daily
                during development. Rebuilding the same logic again and again
                was a waste of time.
              </p>
              <p>
                What began as a few utilities has grown into 100+ focused tools
                covering formatting, generation, conversion, and validation.
              </p>
              <p>
              Rewriting the same helpers for formatting, validation, and quick
             checks became a productivity drain.

            <Section title="4. Philosophy">
              <p>
                Small tools. Clear purpose. Zero distractions. If a tool can’t
                justify its existence, it doesn’t ship.
              </p>
              <p>
              If a feature doesn’t directly help solve a real problem,
              it doesn’t belong.
              </p>
               <p>
                Every tool is judged by one question:
                <em> “Does this save time?”</em>
               </p>
            </Section>


            <Section title="5. Future Direction">
              <p>
                AltF Tools will continue expanding cautiously — prioritizing
                quality, performance, and usefulness over raw tool count.
              </p>
               <p>
                Upcoming improvements focus on better discoverability,
               smarter categorization, and refined UX — not just more tools.
